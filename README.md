## NHANES Data

The file [NHANES_data.py](./NHANES_data.py), contains the main code to download and clean the demographic and oral health and dentition data from [NHANES](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm) website.

We download the data from 2011 to 2018, remain only some of those important variables like the unique id, age and so on. Then we convert different columns to corresponding appropriate type and save the result data frame.
